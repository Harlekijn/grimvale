**Status update on Emiel**

Hi everyone,

  

It has been a while since we have given an update on how Emiels recovery is progressing. 

Last Friday I was able to visit him in the recovery clinic where he is currently staying. 

The good news is that cognitively he is doing really well. We had a 30 minute conversation where he explained what happened, how he noticed and how he and his family experienced the first days in the hospital. He remembers everything and has no gaps.

Physically he is completely drained. He has lost 7 kilos of muscle and looks skinny. He can walk normally, but only for very short stretches. He needs to build back his stamina from the ground up.

He is on the way back though, as he already gained one kilo back!!!
